THAOS_CATEGORIZED Reference Guide
=================================

This document explains the structure, purpose, and usage of the file
THAOS_CATEGORIZED.txt. Use this file as a reference after a memory wipe
to understand what the categorized codex contains and how it was generated.

-------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE OF THAOS_CATEGORIZED.TXT
-------------------------------------

THAOS_CATEGORIZED.txt contains all lines from the cleaned and deduplicated
master codex (THAOS_MASTER_COMBINED_DEDUPE.txt) that could be matched to 
specific worldbuilding categories. This file organizes the extracted lore 
into major thematic groups to make it easier to navigate, analyze, and expand.

The categorized sections rely on a keyword-based heuristic system.

-------------------------------------
2. INCLUDED CATEGORIES
-------------------------------------

The following categories exist in THAOS_CATEGORIZED.txt:

• Geography & Locations
• Characters & Factions
• Magic Systems
• Artifacts & Items
• History & Timeline

Each section contains all lines from the source text that matched one or more 
keywords associated with that category.

THAOS_CATEGORIZED.txt does NOT include:

• Lines that did not match any known category keywords
