THAOS RESTORE SCRIPT (for ChatGPT Upload Workflow)
===============================================

Purpose:
--------
This script is NOT meant to be executed on your computer. 
It is a step-by-step set of instructions for restoring the THAOS worldbuilding environment 
after a memory wipe inside ChatGPT.

===============================================
RESTORE PROCEDURE
===============================================

1. Upload the following files to ChatGPT:
   - THAOS_MASTER_COMBINED_DEDUPE.txt
   - THAOS_CATEGORIZED.txt
   - THAOS_CATEGORIZED_REFERENCE.txt
   - THAOS_PIPELINE_REFERENCE.txt
   - THAOS_BACKUP_MANIFEST.txt (optional)
   - THAOS_NEXT_STEPS.txt (optional)

2. After uploading them, type exactly:
   RESTORE THAOS PROJECT STATE

3. ChatGPT will:
   - Recreate the fix/mindwipe/doink command logic if included in the reference files.
   - Reconstruct all categories.
   - Reload all worldbuilding data.
   - Rebuild your working environment.

===============================================
OPTIONAL: AUTO-VERIFY
===============================================

After the RESTORE command, type:
   VERIFY THAOS RESTORE

ChatGPT will verify:
   - All files are present.
   - The categorized document matches references.
   - No sections are missing.

===============================================
NOTES
===============================================

• This script is future-proof: as long as you include it in your backup ZIP, 
  you can recover your exact workflow at any time.

• You may rename files, but all restore logic assumes the filenames above.

• If you lose your categorized file, ChatGPT can regenerate it from:
     THAOS_MASTER_COMBINED_DEDUPE.txt
  by following instructions in THAOS_CATEGORIZED_REFERENCE.txt.
